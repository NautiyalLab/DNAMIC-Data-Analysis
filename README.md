# AIM - Data Analysis

##### Note: AIM is informally referred to as DNAMIC (Dartmouth Nautiyal Arduino Modular Instrumental Chamber) in the lab. Therefore I might use the two terms (AIM / DNAMIC) interchangeably to refer to the same thing.

This is the third repository in a three-part series containing the data analysis codes for AIM. If you are new to Arduino Instrumental Modules (AIM), please consider visiting this [first repository](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Hardware-Documentations) introducing AIM and explaining the **hardware build instructions.** To learn about the different behavioral paradigms, please visit the [second repository](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Arduino-Software-Programs).
